---
**Background**

- Gregory of Nyssa: Theologian, philosopher, rhetorician
- Stylistic patterns across this corpus

---
**The Pattern**

	ὅσα περὶ τὴν θείαν καθοραται φύσιν
	
- Basic form: verb-noun
- The Question: How common is this across Gregory's corpus?  What different forms can it take?

---

- Begin from 700 raw OCR files
- Extract the XML text from the OCR structure and parse

**Methods**

- Plan: use n-grams and the sliding function to observe each occurrence of the noun-verb pair, and then count backwards from that pair to catch any article or adjective

---
**Avenues for Future Research**
- All of Gregory
- Does frequency vary among different literary forms in the Nyssenian corpus?
- Compare  with classical models 
	- De Anima and the Phaedo
